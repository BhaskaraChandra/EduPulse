Here are the steps to deploy your Django application to Render using Gunicorn:

Step 1: Prepare Your Django Project
1. Make sure your Django project has a requirements.txt file with all dependencies, including Gunicorn.
2. Ensure your settings.py file has ALLOWED_HOSTS set to include your Render domain or * for testing.

Step 2: Create a Procfile (Optional)
Create a Procfile in your project root with the following content:


bash
web: gunicorn your_project.wsgi:application


Replace your_project with the actual name of your Django project.

Step 3: Create a Render Web Service
1. Log in to your Render dashboard.
2. Click on New > Web Service.
3. Select your repository provider (e.g., GitHub).
4. Authenticate and grant Render access to your repository.

Step 4: Configure Your Web Service
1. Select your repository and branch.
2. Set the Environment to Python.
3. Set the Build Command to pip install -r requirements.txt.
4. If you have a Procfile, Render will automatically detect it. Otherwise, set the Start Command to gunicorn your_project.wsgi:application.

Step 5: Configure Environment Variables
1. Add environment variables for your Django project, such as SECRET_KEY, DEBUG (set to False), and any database or other settings.

Step 6: Deploy Your Application
1. Click Create Web Service to deploy your Django application.
2. Render will build and deploy your application.

That's it! Your Django application should now be live on Render.com.
